# astroPy-api-v2

## Description
`astroPy-api-v2` is a simple yet powerful project that leverages the Swiss Ephemeris package to compute essential astrological data necessary for creating an astral chart. This data includes positions of planets, zodiac signs, houses, and aspects between planets. The project is structured around a Flask API, which offers a single route where users can submit their birth data and receive back computed astrological results.
